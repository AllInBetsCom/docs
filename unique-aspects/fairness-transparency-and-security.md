# Fairness, Transparency & Security

At ALLiN BETS, we are unwavering in our commitment to fairness, transparency, and the utmost security in our gaming offerings. Our foundation is built on the renowned Drand protocol, globally celebrated for its ability to generate secure, unbiased, and entirely unpredictable random numbers.

1. **The Role of Drand in Ensuring Game Integrity**
   * **The Drand Protocol Defined**: Drand, short for Distributed Randomness, is an advanced protocol designed to generate sequences of random values that are not only unpredictable but also unbiased and publicly verifiable.
   * **Integration with Comdex Chain**: These random sequences are seamlessly integrated into the Comdex chain through specialized agents known as Drand bots.
   * **Comprehensive Authentication**: To ensure the authenticity of these random numbers, we implement a rigorous authentication process. This procedure guarantees that every game outcome is genuinely random and free from any external manipulation.
2. **Resolution Mechanism for Bets**
   * Bets placed within our platform don't attain immediate conclusions. They undergo a resolution process in the subsequent blockchain blocks, leveraging the freshly-generated randomness specific to that context. This deliberate methodology solidifies the consistent fairness of our games, ensuring our users a reliable and immersive gaming journey.
3. **Safeguarding the ALLiN BETS Ecosystem**
   * **Contract Whitelisting**: We operate on a foundation of trust, and access to our platform's monetary resources is exclusively granted to vetted smart contracts. Our dedicated team meticulously assesses and approves each contract, ensuring the highest level of security. Contracts that do not meet our stringent criteria are unequivocally disallowed.
   * **Block Bet Settlement Incorporating Randomness**: To preserve the integrity of the betting experience, bets are not resolved in real-time. Instead, the system awaits the release of the next blockchain block. Within this block, a distinguished random number, sourced from the trustworthy 'drand,' acts as the decisive factor. This robust structure makes it nearly impossible for any entity to manipulate or predict outcomes in advance. Our commitment remains steadfast: to provide an unbiased and level playing field for all participants.
