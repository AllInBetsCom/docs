# Features

Discover the exclusive features that set ALLiN BETS apart:

**Multiple Bets**

At ALLiN BETS, our "Multiple Bets" feature empowers you to place numerous bets in a single go, streamlining your gaming experience and reducing transaction costs. This convenient option simplifies the process, saving you time and clicks. Importantly, it maintains fairness as each bet remains independent, ensuring unbiased outcomes.

**Skip Animation**

We understand that time is of the essence in your gaming adventure. That's why we introduce the innovative "Skip Animation" feature to provide you with a more efficient and immersive gaming experience.\


With "Skip Animation" enabled, you'll enjoy instant game results. Instead of waiting for animations to play out, the outcomes of all your bets are revealed instantly. With this feature, you can play more and wait less, maximising your gaming enjoyment.

**Stop Gain and Stop Loss**

Our platform offers the flexibility of applying a stop gain, stop loss, or both to your multiple bets, allowing you to control your betting strategy effectively. When either the stop gain or stop loss limit is reached, the game automatically concludes, promoting responsible and customizable gameplay.

Let's illustrate with an example: Imagine selecting 8 bets with a wager of 15 CMDX and setting a stop gain of 30 CMDX. After just 3 games, if you successfully achieve a profit of 30 CMDX, the game halts. Importantly, you'll only be charged for the 3 games played, while the remaining 5 games won't be executed. The same principle applies to stop loss; if you reach your predefined limit, the remaining bets won't be executed, ensuring you stay in control of your gaming experience.

**Leaderboard**

Our casino is not just a place to play; it's a battleground where fortunes are won, rivals are vanquished, and the champions rise to glory!

ðŸŒŸ Weekly Wonders:
