# Rakeback and Incentives

**What is Rakeback?**

Rakeback is a loyalty program designed for online gambling platforms, especially casinos. It is a reward system where a portion of your bet is returned to you, acting as a form of rebate or cashback. It's based on the theoretical house edge, the advantage the casino holds over players in games of chance. Every time you place a bet with AllinBets, you receive a portion of that bet back, with the specific amount determined by your ‘rakeback percentage’. Essentially, the concept rewards players for their engagement: the more you wager, the greater your potential returns through rakeback. This system ensures that players are continuously rewarded, providing an additional incentive to play and wager more on the platform.

**1. Base Rakeback**&#x20;

Every player on ALLiN BETS is entitled to a base rakeback of 3% on every bet they place, irrespective of the game they choose. This ensures that players are rewarded for their gameplay, regardless of the game's outcome. Win or lose, you earn with every bet!

**2. CMDX Staking Bonus**

Beyond the base rakeback, players can significantly enhance their rakeback percentage through CMDX staking. By staking CMDX tokens to secure the chain, players can move through different tiers, each offering an increasing rakeback percentage. The more CMDX you stake, the higher your rakeback rewards.

Here's a breakdown of the staking levels, the required CMDX tokens, and the corresponding rakeback percentages:

**3. CMDX PowerPlay: Boost Your Rakeback**

In addition to the base rakeback and CMDX staking bonuses, we introduce the "CMDX PowerPlay" – a special incentive for those who choose to wager specifically with the CMDX token. When you opt to play with CMDX, you receive a significant 1.5x boost on your earned rakeback.

For instance, if you're at staking Level 5, your total rakeback is 8% (3% base + 5% from staking). By wagering with CMDX, this rakeback gets a 1.5x boost, taking it to 12% (1.5 x 8%).

Here's a table illustrating the enhanced rakeback percentages based on CMDX staking levels, factoring in the CMDX PowerPlay:

By opting for CMDX as your wagering token and leveraging the CMDX PowerPlay, you can significantly amplify your rewards and elevate your gaming experience on our platform.
