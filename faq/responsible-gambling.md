### Preventing Under Age Gambling

All individuals under the age of 18 are strictly prohibited from gambling at ALLiN BETS. We conduct random age verification checks through payment portals. If players are found to be under 18, winnings are forfeited, accounts closed, and relevant authorities in the child's residence country are notified.

Tips for parents include not leaving computers unattended when casino software is running and using gambling bet-blocking and filtering tools like Gamblock, Kaspersky Safe Kids, etc.

2. Increasing Financial Strain: Frequently borrowing money to fund gambling; experiencing financial difficulties and unpaid bills.
3. Loss of Control: Inability to set limits or stop gambling; failed attempts to cut back or quit.
4. Chasing Losses: Engaging in risky behavior to recoup losses; continually increasing bet size to regain money.
5. Neglecting Responsibilities: Ignoring work, school, or family duties due to gambling; failing to fulfill obligations.
6. Lying and Deception: Lying about gambling involvement; concealing financial losses and time spent gambling.
7. Emotional Changes: Experiencing mood swings, anxiety, or irritability; using gambling to cope with stress or depression.
8. Social Isolation: Withdrawing from social activities; feeling more comfortable with fellow gamblers.

### Know the odds

Understanding the odds of gambling is crucial for putting winning chances into perspective. ALLiN BETS offers two products, Casino and Sportsbook, each with different win rates and probabilities.

* House Advantage/House Edge: Games have a house edge to ensure a percentage of the total amount wagered is returned to the house (ALLiN BETS).
* Randomness: All gambling involves an element of randomness, with no way to control outcomes.
* Independent Outcomes: Games/spins are not related, and their outcomes are independent of previous play.
* Odds and Probability: These describe your chances of winning, and while they may seem low, there are no certainties in betting.
